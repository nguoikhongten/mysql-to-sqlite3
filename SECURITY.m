## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it
to us as described below.

**DO NOT CREATE A GITHUB ISSUE** reporting the vulnerability.

Instead, send an email to [techouse@gmail.com](mailto:techouse@gmail.com).

In the report, please include the following:

- Your name and affiliation (if any).
- A description of the technical details of the vulnerabilities. It is very important to let us know how we can
  reproduce your findings.
- An explanation who can exploit this vulnerability, and what they gain when doing so -- write an attack scenario. This
  will help us evaluate your submission quickly, especially if it is a complex or creative vulnerability.
- Whether this vulnerability is public or known to third parties. If it is, please provide details.

If you donâ€™t get an acknowledgment from us or have heard nothing from us in a week, please contact us again.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. We will keep you informed about the progress
towards a fix and full announcement.

We will not disclose your identity to the public without your permission. We strive to credit researchers in our
advisories when we release a fix, but only after getting your permission.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.
